Hi, my name is Adrian, but I go by the handle Munchbyte.  I'm an IT enthusiast with a deep interest in technology. I have dabbled in coding, creating webpages and newsletters, tinkering with and customizing my PC's operating system, and even building my own game using BASIC. Although I didn't consider it as a career when I was younger, my path has now taken me towards the world of IT. I'm starting this blog to aid my learning journey and share my experiences with others.

Web development continues to captivate me, and I'm expanding my knowledge beyond HTML by learning CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, I'm eager to explore cybersecurity, particularly pentesting. Game development has also piqued my interest. I have several other areas I'm keen to explore, such as OSINT, AI, machine learning, cloud computing, blockchain, and NFTs. Undoubtedly, there will be new and exciting things to learn in the future.

While cybersecurity and game development are my primary passions, I recognize the interconnectedness between various fields. The lines between them can sometimes blur, and I'm excited to delve into these overlapping domains. I'm committed to investing significant effort into cybersecurity and game development as I progress.
